## Review from last class

A **variable** is a box to store data. We put the results of expressions into variables using **assignment**.

```{r}
a <- 7
b <- 12
c <- a + b
print(c)
```

Rules for variable names: start with a letter then letters, numbers, `.` or `_`


## Naming variables meaningfully

While syntax rules ensure your code compiles, choosing descriptive names makes it easier to understand and work with. For e.g:

Here is a program to find the area of a circle

**Bad style**

```{r}
a <- 5
b <- pi * a ^ 2
print(b)
```

**Good style**


```{r}
circle_radius <- 5
circle_area <- pi * circle_radius^2
print(paste("The area of the circle is:", circle_area))
```

Wondering what is `paste`? Ask R with `?paste` or `help(paste)` expressions.


* RStudio's TAB completion makes it effortless to enter variable names after they've been declared.
* On HW assignments, we will awarding for good *style* (readable code)
* You are encouraged to follow the coding style suggested by tidyverse: https://style.tidyverse.org/

## How does `knit` work in RStudio?

When you **knit** an RMarkdown document, RStudio **starts a new process**.

Every time it encounters an **R chunk** it **evaluates** the R code inside and inserts the output into the document (default; can be changed). 


**Order is important**

Because **statements** change the state, order of statements is very important.

```{r warning=FALSE}
a <- 7
a <- 2
print(a)  
```

**Working with code chunks, debugging hint**

If you run into a problem (for e.g., a weird behavior that you can't explain logically), use the `Session -> Restart R` to clean up, and the use "Run all chunks above". Then try the chunk again. 

## What can go in variables?

R has several different **data types**. Some common types:

* **Numeric**: `7`, `3.22`, `9.1e2`
* **Strings**: `"Hello"` or `'Hello'` (also called "character vectors")
* **Logicals**: `TRUE` and `FALSE`
* We'll see more data types going forward
* These are also referred to as the **class** of the data.

## Why are variables useful?

* Avoid repeatedly typing in the same thing
* Save the results of computations
* Avoid recomputing same values

**Exercise: Using variables**

Find the difference between 193 and 7. What is this value divided by two? What is this value divided by three? 
The below code does solve the given problem. Can you make it more efficient using variables?

```{r using-variables, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

193 - 7

(193 - 7) / 2

((193-7) / 2) / 3

```


## Functions 
A key tool in any programming language is a **function**.

* R functions behave (mostly) like mathematical functions $f(x)$.
* They take **arguments** and return **values**
* Encapsulate code (mini-programs)
* Make it easy to repeat operations

**Syntax**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
return_value <- f(argument1, argument2, named_argument = additional_data, ...)
```

* Like math functions, we use the syntax `f()` to run the function
* All **arguments** are **passed** to the function inside of the `()` separated by commas
* Arguments can be passed in **positional** order or
* Passed by **name**
* Some arguments are **optional** when they have a default value
* `...` means "any number of additional arguments"
* `return_value` is the output of the function


## Defining functions

```{r, results='hide'}
mult <- function(x, y) { 
  print(paste('x =' , x, ', y =', y))
  x * y 
}
```

The `mult` function takes in two arguments and multiplies them

```{r}
mult(2, 10)
mult(y = 5, x = 3)
```
There are many built-in functions in R that you can simply use.

[Glimpse at R Vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html)


## Function evaluation

In R, when we call a function, first the **arguments** are evaluated, then the function is called.

```{r}
mult(2, mult(2,3))
```



## Avoiding single use variables

Sometimes we only need to use a statement once, so taking the time to come up with a variable name is unnecessary. 

Instead we can use **pipes** to pass the output of one function to the **first argument** of a second function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
value <- f()
g(value)

# pipes
f() |> g()
```

```{r}
mult(2.5, 3) |> round()
```

In older R programs, you also see another notation for pipe `%>%`.
With this notation the same expression can be 

```{r}
mult(2.5, 3) %>% round
```

Note: We did not have to put the pair of parenthesis for this notation. If you do put, it doesn't hurt


## We know that arrow can be reversed


```{r}
7 -> variable_reversed
pi * variable_reversed
pi |> sqrt() -> sqrt_pi
sqrt_pi
```

There is a subtle difference between using `=` and `->` or `<-` when it comes to functions.  For example, the below function does not work if you use arrow. So for any function call key/value arguments, you have to use `=`


```{r arrow, exercise = T}
x = c(10)
try_me <- function(y = x){
  print(y)
}
try_me(x)

```

## Some special values

R has special data values

* `NA` means "missing". Including a `NA` value in a calculation will usually make the result also `NA`.
* `NULL` means "not set yet" and is often used for optional arguments to functions
* `NaN` means Not a Number.  Typically impossible values like dividing a complex number by zero gets you NaN. Apply to real and imaginary parts of complex values.

You can think of the value of NA (for the most part NaN also) as "I don't know". Thus, logical and mathematical operations involving NA will again return NA, so that NAs "propagate through" the computation:

```{r}
NA + 5 # 5 + I-don't-know = I-don't-know
1 < NA  # Is 1 less than I-don't-know? I don't know.
NA < NA  # Is I-don't-know greater than I-don't-know? I don't know.
NA == 1
```
Since you cannot test NAs for equality, R has a special function for determining whether a value is NA:

```{r}
is.na(NA)
is.na(1)
```
Now, what will happen with this code?

```{r na-prop}
values = c(1, 2, NA)
mean(values)
```

Instead add the keyword argument `na.rm = T` to instruct the function to first remove all the NA values and then compute the mean

```{r}
mean(values, na.rm = T)
```



## Lists and Vectors

* A **vector** is an ordered collection of the same type of data. Created using the `c` function (concatenate).
* A **list** is an ordered collection of (potentially) different types of data. Created using the `list` function.
* Both can have **names** to indicate individual items.

**Vector example**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
phone_digits <- c(8, 6, 7, 4, 3, 0, 9)
phone_plus_area_code <- c(7, 3, 4, phone_digits)
print(phone_plus_area_code)
length(phone_plus_area_code)
sum(phone_plus_area_code)
str_flatten(phone_plus_area_code)
```

We will learn more on *str* functions when we learn Strings.

**List example**

Lists are heterogeneous while vectors are homogeneous

```{r}
mixed_type_list <- list(3, 4, phone_digits)
mixed_type_list
list("umich", 1, T)
c("umich", 1, T)
```



## Vectors, indexing

The `runif` function will create randomly generated values in the range (0, 1).

```{r}
random_u01 <- runif(10) # create 10 values
print(random_u01)
random_u01[1] # first item
random_u01[10] # last item
random_u01[-1] # all but first
random_u01[1:3] # first three
random_u01[c(1, 3, 7, 1)]
```



## Relational Operators

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 2

x < y
x > y
x <= y
x >= y
x == y
x != y

!(x == y) # negation
```

**Assignment vs equality**

An extremely common mistake for beginner programmers is to confuse = and == ("double equals") when writing code. As we have seen,

>* = is used for; assigning a value to a variable, and passing a named parameter into a function.
>* == is used for testing equality.

## Boolean operations

Logical expressions are combined using boolean operations. The basic boolean operations are and, or, and not, denoted &, | and ! respectively.

```{r}
! FALSE
FALSE | TRUE
! TRUE
```

R abbreviates TRUE and FALSE as T and F

```{r}
c(T, F)
```



## Vectors, subsetting using relational operators

```{r}
random_u01
less_than_0.5 <- random_u01 < 0.5
print(less_than_0.5)
random_u01[less_than_0.5]
keep(random_u01, random_u01 < 0.5)
random_u01[!less_than_0.5]
```



## Named collections

Vectors can have names (`c(first = 1, second = 22, third = 333)`), but names for lists are more common.
```{r}
named_list <- list(a_string = "Some value", a_vector = 1:4)
named_list[["a_string"]] # note double brackets
named_list$a_string
```

## Testing for membership
Another useful operator is %in%:

```{r}
"a" %in% c(1, 2, 3)  # this statement is equivalent to the one below
("a" == 1) | ("a" == 2) | ("a" == 3)
```

## `ifelse` function
`ifelse()` is a function from `base R` that takes three vector arguments and returns a new vector. 

```{r}
# Define a vector
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Use ifelse to create a new vector
y <- ifelse(x > 3, "large", 0)

y
```

## What about `if_else`?
`tidyverse` is a popular R package for data analytics. `tidyverse` comes with many packages that includes `dplyr`

`if_else` comes from dplyr and works the same as `ifelse` except the output from the `if_else` should be of the same type

```{r}
y <- if_else(x > 3, "large", 'small')
y
```

## Tables in R

In data analytics we often work with Tabular data where:

>* columns are variables
>* rows are observations

A tabular data is presented using a `tibble` or `data.frame`.
When we construct new tabular data, we will use `tibble` (from `dplyr`; part of `tidyverse`) as that is a better data structure than `data.frame` from base R package. However many existing old libraries use `data.frame`.
We will treat them interchangeably for the most part.

You construct a simple tibble with two columns named `a` and `b` as shown below

```{r}
tibble(a = c(1:10),
       b = c(11:20))
```
Think of a data frame as a container for a bunch of vectors of data:

<img src='./images/tibble.png' width = "1000px" />

There are many tabular datasets readily available when we load `tidyverse` among them `mpg` is one of them. There are many functions you can use on the tibble and here we will see some of them

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
class(mpg)
dim(mpg)
colnames(mpg)
head(mpg)
```

Why does the `class(mpg)` give you three different class names?

because

>* data.frame: The base R data structure for representing tabular data.
>* tbl: A generic interface for working with tabular data. tibbles implement this interface.
>* tbl_df: A specific implementation of the tbl interface, providing a more modern and feature-rich data frame experience. It builds on the data.frame structure.

## Accessing individual columns

Recall, the `$` operator lets us get items from lists:

```{r}
mpg$hwy |> mean() # equiv to mean(mpg$hwy)
```

## Other functions for basic descriptive statistics

```{r}
sum(mpg$hwy)
var(mpg$hwy)
sqrt(var(mpg$hwy)) # standard deviation
median(mpg$hwy)
IQR(mpg$hwy)
quantile(mpg$hwy, c(0.25, 0.75))
```

All at once

```{r}
summary(mpg)
```

## Dealing with missingness

To delete the missing values we have some options. Let us look into the `storms` data; another tabular data provided by NOAA Atlantic hurricane database representing the positions and attributes of storms from 1975-2022. 

```{r}
storms |> head()
```


```{r}
storms$category |> mean()
storms$category |> mean(na.rm = T)
na.omit(storms$category) |> mean()
storms$category[!is.na(storms$category)] |> mean()
```

To find how many missing values are present in the category column

```{r}
is.na(storms$category) |> table()
```
