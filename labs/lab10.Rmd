  - `for` loops

       [do something for each index]
    }
  ```
  - `while` loops
  Syntax:

- The Map Family
  - Maps: The `map` functions are **functionals** (_a function that takes a function 
  as an input and returns a vector as output_). They take **lists** or **atomic vectors** 
  and a **function** as arguments.
  - Variants of Map:
    - `map_int()` creates an integer vector.
    - `map_dbl()` creates a double vector.
    - `map_chr()` creates a character vector.
    - `map_lgl()` creates a logical vector.
    - `map_df()` creates a dataframe.
  - Map with multiple inputs
    - `map2()` for two inputs
    - `pmap()` parallel map, for multiple inputs
    
## Mapping over multiple arguments
So far we’ve mapped along a single input. But often you have multiple related inputs that you need iterate along in parallel. That’s the job of the` map2()` and `pmap()` functions. For example, imagine you want to simulate some random normals with different means. You know how to do that with `map2()`:
  
```{r}
set.seed(306)
mu <- list(5, 10, -3)
sigma <- list(1, 5, 10)
map2(mu, sigma, rnorm, n = 5) %>% str()
```
Or we can use the shortcut
```{r}
map2(mu, sigma, ~rnorm(5, .x, .y)) %>% str()

```
`map2()` generates this series of functions calls:
![](images/map2.png){width=90%}

For more arguments, we can use `pmap()`
```{r}
n <- list(1, 3, 5)
mu <- list(5, 10, -3)
sigma <- list(1, 5, 10)
args1 <- list(n, mu, sigma)
args1 %>%
  pmap(rnorm) %>% 
  str()
```
`pmap()` generates this series of functions calls:
![](images/pmap.png){width=90%}

## Invoking different functions
There’s one more step up in complexity - as well as varying the arguments to the 
function you might also vary the function itself:
```{r}
f <- c("runif", "rnorm", "rpois")
param <- list(
  list(min = -1, max = 1), 
  list(sd = 5), 
  list(lambda = 10)
)
```
To handle this case, we can use `invoke_map()`
```{r}
invoke_map(f, param, n = 5) %>% str()
```
`invoke_map()` generates this series of functions calls:
![](images/invoke_map.png){width=90%}

However, we see the warning that `invoke_map()` was decprecated in purrr 1.0.0.
Instead, we can use `pmap() + exec()` as the following:
```{r}
pmap(list(f, param), ~ exec(..1, !!!(..2), n = 5)) %>% str()

```
where `..2` refers to the second argument passed to the anonymous function, which corresponds to the parameter lists. `!!!(..2)` unquotes and splices the elements of the parameter list as individual arguments for the `exec()` call.


## The Apply Family
The apply family of functions in base R (`apply()`, `lapply()`, `mapply()`, etc) are
used as alternatives to loops.

## apply()
`apply()` is used to apply functions over array margins. The usage of `apply` is
```
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE)
```
where `X` is an array or matrix, `MARGIN` is a vector that giving the substcripts which the function will be over. `MARGIN` is a variable defining how the function is applied: when `MARGIN=2`, it applies over columns. In higher dimensional data, `MARGIN` select the axes/dimensions and how the functions applies to. `FUN` is the function to be applied.
Here is an example in 2D matrix: construct a $5 \tinmes 6$ matrix and sum the values of each column.
```{r}
mat<- matrix(1:30, nrow = 5, ncol = 6)
col_sums <- apply(mat, 2, sum)
print(col_sums)
```

### Excercise 1
Sum the values of each rows of the matrix usibng `apply`. What happend when we set the `MARGIN=c(1,2)`
```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}
mat<- matrix(1:30, nrow = 5, ncol = 6)
```
```{r Ex1-solution}
mat<- matrix(1:30, nrow = 5, ncol = 6)
row_sums <- apply(mat, 2, sum)
print(row_sums)

row_sums <- apply(mat, c(1,2), sum)
print(row_sums)
# It applies both rows and columns, so the sum is applying on each element of the matrix.
```

### Apply over 3D array
Use `apply()` to sum along the 3rd axis of a 3D array 
```{r}
array_3d <- array(runif(3*4*5), dim = c(3, 4, 5))
print(array_3d)
```
```{r}
apply(array_3d, MARGIN=c(1, 2), sum)
```

## lapply()
`lapply()` is basically identical to `map()`, except that `map()` is consistent with all the other functions in `purrr`, and you can use the shortcuts for `.f`. It is used to apply a function over a list or vector. The usage of `lapply` is
```
lapply(X, FUN, ...)
```
where `X` is a vector (atomic or list) or an expression object and `FUN` is the function to be applied to each element of `X`. Here is an example:
```{r}
x <- list(list(1, 2, 3), list(4, 5, 6), list(7, 8, 9))
lapply(x, function(lst) lst[[2]]) %>% str() # select the second element for each sub-list
```
Using function shortcut
```{r}
lapply(x, purrr::as_mapper( ~. [[2]])) %>% str()
```
Or
```{r}
lapply(x, `[[`, 2) %>% str()
```
Shortcut is similar to `lambda` function in Python, but it can only work in functions in `purrr` packages directly.


### Exercise 2
Sample **5** observations from normal distributions with different $\mu$. 
```{r Ex2, exercise=TRUE}
mu <- list(5, 10, -3)
```

```{r Ex2-solution}
mu <- list(5, 10, -3)
lapply(mu, rnorm, n=5) %>% str() 
```

### sapply()
`sapply()` is a wrapper around `lapply()` that automatically simplifies the output. The result be simplified to a vector, matrix or higher dimensional array if possible. The usage is:
```
sapply(X, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)
```
Here is an example:
```{r}
sapply(x, `[[`, 2)
```


## mapply()
`mapply()` is basically identical to `pmap()` that it is used to apply a function to multiple list or vectors. The usage of `mapply` is
```
mapply(FUN, ..., MoreArgs = NULL, SIMPLIFY = TRUE,
       USE.NAMES = TRUE)
```
where `FUN` is the function to apply, `...` are the arguments to vectorize over, and `MoreArgs` is a list of other arguments to `FUN`. Here is an example using `rep` function to generate a 2D list.

```{r}
mapply(rep, times = 1:4, x = 4:1)
```
There are several arguements in `rep`  with usage `rep(x, ...)`, where `x` is a vector for replicating, and `times` is an integer-valued vector giving the (non-negative) number of times to repeat each elemen.
```{r}
mapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1)
```

### Excersie 3
Construct a $6 \times 5$ matrix that each row is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` using `mapply` and `rep`.
```{r Ex3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r Ex3-solution}
mapply(rep, 1:5, 6)
```
